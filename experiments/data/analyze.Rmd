```

```{r}
d = read.csv("subjrand-1-trials.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```{r}
d %>% group_by(sequence) %>% summarise(n=n())
```

for each sequence, how many subjects say heads versus tails?
```{r}
d %>% group_by(sequence) %>% summarise(n.heads = sum(response == "H"), n.tails = sum(response == "T"))
```
