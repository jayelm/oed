\section{Introduction}
\lou{start off more generally, don't specialize too much for psychology.}
Designing scientific experiments is hard.
Scientists must have hypotheses and reason over a potentially large space of possible experiments.
Studying human behavior has additional complications.
Human data is noisy and sensitive to the dependent measure of the task.
Further, human data is expensive and one must balance expected statistical power with the constraints of a limited budget to decide on the number of participants to run.

Formal models of psychological phenomena alleviate some of these issues.
Models make explicit hypotheses about observed data, and thus make it easier (or in some cases, possible) to explore the implications of a set of theoretical ideas.
However, exploring models can be time-consuming and searching through a large space of possible experiments is still largely driven by the scientist's intuition.
This need not be the case: If both the set of hypotheses and the space of experiments are explicit, then we can partially \emph{automate} experiment design as a sort of active learning problem, searching for experiments that maximally update our beliefs about a scientific question.

We present a general, principled, and turnkey approach to designing experiments that uses a Bayesian approach to find experiments that best distinguish competing hypotheses.
The approach is similar in spirit to other Bayesian approaches to experiment design going back to Lindley \cite{Lindley1956} (for a review, see \cite{Chaloner1995}).
We go beyond simple probability models, however, and implement the framework  in a \emph{probabilistic programming language} (PPL), providing new generality to the approach.
PPLs are a convenient and compositional way to represent explicit hypotheses about the data.
We show how optimal experiment design (OED) can be streamlined into a scientist's workflow by instantiating it in a user-friendly PPL in which formal hypotheses can already be expressed.
This is a crucial step in making a practical OED system: Once you're using a PPL to formalize your hypotheses, OED comes for free.
%\lou{as explained, this doesn't seem so crucial to me.}

%Though the framework is Bayesian, it is not directly related to Bayesian models of cognition; rather, it can be applied to any instance in which the scientist has a formal model of the data generating process (including, Bayesian models of cognition).

We are not the first to attempt to develop a framework for optimal experiments in psychology.
Previous attempts (e.g. \cite{Myung2009}), however, suffer from a number of pragmatic issues, including ad-hoc optimization criteria, lack of an established pipeline, and failure to accommodate common worries in psychology experiments (e.g., dealing with noisy responses, determining sample sizes, and selecting dependent measures or linking functions).
% Taken together, these issues put the burden on researchers to have sufficient expertise to adapt the OED system to their specific problem and require researchers to develop their own system for writing formal psychological models and the OED optimization engine.
In this paper, we resolve these issues using a Bayesian model selection framework implemented in a practical modeling system.
We apply this framework to two case studies from cognitive psychology: perceptions of subjective randomness and category learning.
The first case study highlights the details of application for a simple space of experiments.
The second study applies OED to a more realistic space of possible experiments and validates our theoretical analysis by running the optimal experiment.
Our general system opens a number of rich areas for future development, which we explore in the discussion.

%We conclude by highlighting the generality of the approach and areas of future work.
%\ndg{all the parts are here. needs smoothing. make it clearer that using PPL to represent hypotheses is a key step in making the system practical.}

\section{Bayesian model selection framework}
\label{s:bayes}



\cas{because probabilistic programming is so crucial to our work, we give an introduction to the language we use, webppl}

\cas{walk through biased coin, markov coin models}

\cas{re-emphasize 2 benefits of ppls: clear hypotheses, plug and play inference}

\cas{discuss sample(), condition(), factor() (= likelihood weighting), score()}

\lou{we assume that subjects are iid and that each subject's response is conditionally iid given their latent values.. discussion: relax these assumptions, connect with mixed models (maybe having linking functions gives us this?)}

Let $P(X)$ be a prior distribution on experiments, $P(Y)$ a prior on possible responses, and $P(M)$ a prior on models.
A model $m$ is a conditional distribution $P_m(Y \mid X)$ that represents predictions about response data $y_i$ for different possible experiments $x_i$ (we will use the notation $m(x)$ as shorthand for $P_m(Y \mid X = x)$).

The goal of OED is to find the experiment $x^{*}$ that maximizes the expected information gain about the belief distribution on models $P(M \mid X = x^{*})$.
We use KL divergence as our measure of information gain:
\lou{it's not immediately clear what $p(m \mid x)$ means, so cut this, probably}
\begin{align}
  \dkl{ p(m \mid x) }{ p(m) }  = \sum\limits_m p(m \mid x) \ln \left( \frac{p(m \mid x)}{p(m)}\right). \label{eq:kl}
\end{align}

The optimal experiment $x^*$ maximizes the expected KL divergence over the space of responses:

\begin{align}
x^{*} &= \argmax_{x} p(x) \sum\limits_{y} p(y) \dkl{ P(M \mid Y = y) }{ P(M) } \notag \\
    &= \argmax_{x} p(x) \sum\limits_{y} \left[\sum\limits_{m} p_m(y \mid x)p(m)\right] \dkl{P(M \mid Y = y)}{P(M)}. \label{eq:oed}
\end{align}

\subsection{Probabilistic programs}

Complex probabilisitic models require new representations to support their specification. Probabilistic programs are such a representation, extending probabilistic graphical models with insights from programming language research.
PPLs provide compositionality and abstraction, which are incredibly useful for articulating clear formal hypotheses. In addition, PPLs separate model description from implementation, and generic tools for calculating efficient probabilistic inference can be swapped in on a need-to-use basis, depending on the type of model described.
We implement our OED system as a probabilistic program, allowing us to harness these two benefits.

We use the probabilistic programming language WebPPL (\url{webppl.org}), a small but feature-rich probabilistic programming language embedded in Javascript \cite{dippl}.
WebPPL uses primitive Distribution objects (e.g. \lstinline{Binomial}), which can be accessed with a number of different methods: \lstinline{sample}, \lstinline{score}, \lstinline{support}.
For instance, \lstinline|sample(Binomial({n: 4, p: 0.5}))| returns a sample from the Binomial distribution with parameters $n=4, p = 0.5$. \lstinline|score(Binomial({n: 4, p: 0.5}), 2)| will return the log-probability of the value 2 under the Binomial distribution.
Oftentimes, we are interested in posterior inference. Let's say we are interested in the Binomial(4, 0.5) distribution conditioned on at least 2 positive outcomes. In WebPPL, we would write that as
%
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, label={code:webppl}, caption = {Posterior inference in WebPPL.}]
var myBinomialModel = function(){
	var x = sample(Binomial({n: 4, p: 0.5}))
	condition(x >= 2)
	return x
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
In Listing \ref{code:webppl}, we've constructed a function with no arguments (i.e., a thunk: \lstinline{myBinomialModel}), which samples from a Binomial distribution, uses the WebPPL primitive \lstinline{condition} to specify how we want to update our distribution, and returns the resulting sampled value \lstinline{x}.
\lstinline{condition} looks to see if the condition is satsfied (if $x\geq2$); if it is not, it re-weights the likelihood of that \emph{program execution} (composed of all of the random choices made before the condition statement) to 0.
\lstinline{condition} is a special case of \lstinline{factor}, which adjusts the (log) likelihood of the program execution by some value (most often, the log probability of the data under that program execution).

Notice how this model has not specified \emph{how} we are to construct a posterior distribution. For that, we would call this function with a generic inference routine \lstinline{Infer(myBinomialModel, options)}. In \lstinline{options}, we would specify what inference algorithm we want to use. WebPPL currently has several inference algorithms to choose from: MCMC, full Enumeration, HMC, Sequential Monte Carlo, and Variational Inference.

Because we have expressed the space of models, experiments, and responses in the language of probability, it is straightforward to express Equation \ref{eq:oed} as a probabilistic program (see Listing \ref{code:oed-pp}).
This makes it clear that OED is an inference problem.
Attacking this problem using probabilistic programming allows us to separate the task of describing the problem (i.e., writing the generative model of OED) from the task of solving it (i.e., choosing/writing the inference algorithm).
In addition, framing OED this way gives us access to algorithms that are more sophisticated than previous research has considered  (e.g., HMC for continuous experiment spaces).
\lou{note that outermost Infer() could also be a Search()}

\section{Case study 1: Subjective randomness}
\label{s:tutorial}

Human judgments about randomness are surprisingly systematic and nonuniform across equally random outcomes -- for example, a sequence of outcomes of coin flips \lstinline{HTHTTTHH} is considered to be more random than the sequence \lstinline{HHHHHHHH} ~\cite{goodfellow38:jep, griffiths01:cogsci}.
%This discrepancy between human intuitions and statistical fact about randomness has garnered significant attention from both the mathematical~\cite{chaitin01:er, kac83:as, li97:kca} and psychological~\cite{falk81:pme, lopes82:jep, griffiths01:cogsci} literature.

\subsection{Model space}

There are many hypotheses one might have about what underlies human intuitions about randomness.
Here, we consider two simple hypotheses: (a) \emph{Weighted coin}: Participants reason about the weight of the coin (i.e., the probability of a \lstinline{H} outcome), and (b) \emph{Markov coin}: participants reason about the transition probabilities between \lstinline{H} and \lstinline{T} outcomes.
We consider an experimental setup where participants observe four flips of the same coin and are asked to predict the outcome of the next flip.

Formally, the set of models is $\{m_{\text{weighted}}, m_{\text{markov}}\}$, the set of experimental designs $\mathcal{X}$ is the set of all possible sequences of four coin flips, and the set of responses $\mathcal{Y}$ is a choice between heads or tails for the fifth flip.

\lou{add fair coin + 3-model power analysis?}\\
\mht{add number of subjects analysis?}

\subsubsection{Weighted coin model}
\label{s:tutorial:sss:biased}

The weighted coin model models a participant who assumes that coin that generated the observed sequence has some unknown bias and that each coin flip is independent.\footnote{This is a model of a \emph{person's model} of the situation. For more details on this kind of cognitive modeling, see \url{https://probmods.org}}
In this model, the weight of the coin is inferred from the observed sequence of flips by trying to generate the observed sequence, and conditioning on the generated sequence matching the observed sequence.
The inferred coin weight is subsequently used to predict the next coin flip. We show the model in Listing~\ref{lst:m_weighted}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Biased coin model,  label={lst:m_weighted}]
var coin_weights = [0.01,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,0.99]

var weightedCoin = function(seq) {
  Enumerate(function(){
    var bias_p = uniformDraw(coin_weights);
    var flip_weightedCoin = function(){return flip(bias_p)}
    var generated_seq = repeat(seq.length, flip_weightedCoin)
    condition(seq == generated_seq)
    return flip_weightedCoin()
  })
}
\end{lstlisting}

%
The model first samples a coin weight \lstinline{bias_p} from a discretized uniform distribution over coin weights, and
then makes a helper function \lstinline{flip_weightedCoin} which will flip the weighted coin.
The model then generates a sequence of coin flips of the length of the sequence observed \lstinline{repeat(seq.length, flip_weightedCoin)} and conditions on this matching the observed sequence \lstinline{seq}.
The built-in function \lstinline{condition} rejects executions of the program that fail to match the condition \lstinline{seq==generated_seq}.
The model returns the outcome of the next coin flip.
The model specification is called with an inference algorithm (here, \lstinline{Enumerate} --- which fully enumerates the entire probability distribution), and returns the posterior distribution on the model's return value (here, the outcome of the next coin flip).
%posterior predictive distribution over the next outcome \lstinline{flip(bias_p)}.

\subsubsection{Markov coin model}
\label{s:tutorial:sss:markov}
The Markov coin model assumes that the coin is generated by a Markov process where each coin flip depends on the previous coin flip. The probability of transitioning from the current coin flip is inferred from the experiment prompt sequence, and is subsequently used to predict the next coin flip.
%

%   (define (transition prev) (flip (if isfair
%                                       0.5
%                                       (if prev 0.1 0.9))))
%
%   (define (markov prev n)
%     (if (= 0 n)
%         '()
%         (let ((next (transition prev)))
%           (pair next (markov next (- n 1))))))

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Markov coin model]
var markovCoin = function(seq) {
  Enumerate(function(){
    var transition_p =  uniformDraw(coin_weights);
    var flip_markovCoin = function(prev_outcome){
    		return flip(prev_outcome ? 1-transition_p : transition_p)
	 }
	// NEED TO FINISH

    var logLkhd = sum(map2(function(x,y) {
    		var p = x ? 1-transition_p : transition_p
     	 	return bernoulliERP.score([p], y)
    	},
    	seq.slice(0, seq.length-1),
    	seq.slice(1, seq.length)
	  ));

    condition(seq == generated_seq)
    return flip_markovCoin(last(generated_seq))
  })
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
This model samples a coin weight \lstinline{transition_p} from a discretized uniform distribution over weights.
At each point in the sequence, we examine what the previous outcome was (\lstinline{x?}): If the last outcome was heads, the probability that this outcome is heads is \lstinline{1-transition_p}; if the last outcome was tails, the probability that this outcome is heads is \lstinline{transition_p}. Thus, the sequence of outcomes follows a Markov process.

\subsection{Predictions of optimal experiment design}

We run OED by calling the \lstinline{OED} function on a distribution of models and a distribution of experiments; it then returns the expected information gain for every experiment (Fig.~\ref{fig:run-coin}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\underline{\textsf{Input:}}
\begin{lstlisting}
OED({mSample: function() { uniformDraw([weight, markov]) }),
     xSample: function() { repeat(4, flip) }, // experiment space
     ySample: function() { flip() }) // response space
\end{lstlisting}

\underline{\textsf{Output:}}\\
\includegraphics[width=3in]{img/coin.eps}
\caption{Running OED in the subjective randomness domain}
\lou{make this figure in ggplot, clean it up}
\label{fig:run-coin}
\end{figure}

We see that \lstinline{HTHT} and \lstinline{THTH} are the most informative experiments.
Inuitively, this is sensible -- the weighted model infers a 0.5 probability of heads and so assigns equal probability of heads and tails to the next flip, whereas the Markov infers that the probability of transitioning from one outcome to the other is quite high and assigns high probability to the opposite of the last observed value (\lstinline{T} for \lstinline{THTH} and \lstinline{H} for \lstinline{HTHT}).

We also see that \lstinline{HHHH} and \lstinline{TTTT} are the least informative experiments.
Informally, this is because the models make the same predictions for these experiments.
For instance, for \lstinline{HHHH}, the weighted model infers a high probability of heads and so assigns high probability of heads to the next flip.
The Markov model infers a low probability of transitioning from heads to tails, so it also assigns a high probability of heads to the next flip.

\subsection{Empirical validation of optimal experiment design}
We validated our OED system by running all of the experiments in the experimental space and comparing the expected information gain with the empirically measured information gain. 

\subsubsection{Experimental procedure}

We recruited 320 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The procedure consisted of a single experiment from the experimental space (i.e. a sequence of 4 coin flips). Participants were randomly assigned to an experiment and generated each coin flip by pressing a button, until all outcomes were shown. Participants then made a prediction about the outcome of the next coin flip (either heads or tails). All of the 16 possible experiments were completed by 20 unique participants. The experiment took about 30 seconds and participants were compensated \$0.10 for their involvement. The experiment in full can be viewed at \url{http://stanford.edu/~mtessler/oed/oed/experiments/subjective-randomness/experiment.html}

\subsubsection{Results}

\red{For each experiment, we calculate the empirical information gain by ...}



\section{Case study 2: Category learning}

Optimal experiment design has the possibility of addressing experiment and model spaces of arbitrary complexity. Our second case study  analyzes a classic paper in the psychology of categorization by Medin and Schaffer~\cite{medin78:pr}, who sought to distinguish two competing models of category learning -- the so-called \emph{exemplar model} and the \emph{prototype model} -- by running a cleverly designed experiment.
In this case study, the models are more complex than the subjective randomness models, which make it difficult to think through the predictions of each. 
Further, the experimental space is substantially larger than the subjective randomness experiment space. Here, there are \red{XXX} number of possible experiments.

Here, we ask: from an information-theoretic perspective, how good was the experiment that Medin and Schaffer designed?
Using OED, we find that there are many superior experiments that Medin and Schaffer could have designed but did not.\footnote{Our work here is an exercise in counterfactual history; the exemplar and prototype models, as expressed in the Medin and Schaffer work, are not state of the art models. We chose the Medin and Schaffer research (rather than newer work) as an object of study because it commits to a clear set of competing models and a clear and tractable set of possible experiments.}


%
%Medin and Schaffer found that the exemplar model better fit the results of this experiment, and determined it the better model of human category learning.
%
%\lou{rewrite this paragraph}
%%We now consider a richer example in the domain of category learning.
%
%The ability to form concepts and abstract rules establishes a foundation for naming objects and events and is an integral component to cognition.
%Classifying observations and experience into categories is a fundamental learning phenomenon, and models of classification learning have been an active area of research in cognitive science for decades~\cite{machery10:bbs}.
%


%\lou{worth noting that having oed allows us to determine information-theoretic value of the MS experiment.}

% and illustrates how automated experiment design can outperform human intuition. In particular, this case study demonstrates the efficacy of OED in psychology for discrete and non-ordinal experiment spaces, large combinatoric experiment spaces, and parametric model classes.

\subsection{Models}

Both exemplar and prototypes models can be viewed as classifiers that map inputs (here, a vector of boolean features) to a probability distribution on the outputs (a category label: A or B).
The exemplar model assumes people store information about every instance of the category they have observed; categorizing an object is thus a function of the object's similarity to all of the examples of category A versus the similarity to all of B's examples.

%\cas{both models are classifiers that take as input an object (a vector of boolean features) and return as output a probability distribution on a/b categorization}

%\cas{exemplar model assumes that people store information about every exemplar they've seen and that categorization of an object is a function of similarity to all A exemplars versus B exemplars}

% \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Exemplar model (TODO: clearer input/output types)]
% var exemplar = function(as, bs) {
%   var weights = repeat(4, function() { uniform(0,5) })
%   Enumerate(function() {
%     var object = repeat(4, function() { flip() ? 1 : 0});
%     var sim = function(x,y) {
%       product(map3(
%          function(xi,yi, wi) { (xi == yi) ? 1 : wi },
%          x, y, weights))
%     };
%     var aSims = sum(map(function(a) { return sim(object, a) }, as));
%     var bSims = sum(map(function(b) { return sim(object, b) }, bs));
%     condition(flip(ssa / (ssa + ssb)));
%     return {object: object, prob: prob}
%   })
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

The prototype modes assumes instead that people store, for each category, a prototype. Categorization of an object is thus a function of its similarity to the prototype of category A versus the prototype of category B.
\cas{(this model produces rank orderings but we did a transform so that it gives numbers)}

\subsection{Experiments}

\cas{4 binary dimensions - 16 objects total}

\cas{constraints: 9 training stimuli (5 A's and 4 B's)}

\cas{measure: recall and transfer}

\subsection{Results of optimal experimental design}

\cas{we enumerated the 933 valid and unique (up to permuting the dimensions) experiments in terms of expected information gain.}

\cas{we found that the MS experiment was not the best. TODO: reproduce daniel's results (Fig.~\ref{fig:dist})}

\cas{the optimal experiment that we found was TODO}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{img/dist.eps}
\caption{The distribution of optimal experiments with the MS bin highlighted in red. TODO: add predictions of MS and opt experiment}
\label{fig:dist}
\end{figure}

The MS uses a qualitative swap in ranking for two stimuli to disambiguate the models.
However, this prediction has a relatively small magnitude and comes at the expense of little information gain from the remaining stimuli.
The optimal experiment is better able to quantitatively disambiguate the models by maximizing the information from all the stimuli simultaneously
\lou{note that the OED framework is quite flexible. in our model space, we can also encode hard constraints like ``the models must predict different rank orderings''}

\cas{we did a power analysis to determine the number of subjects we'd need.}

\cas{we conducted the actual experiments. empirical information gain from MS was TODO, empirical information gain from opt was TODO.}

\cas{explain different scales for theoretical versus empirical information gain}

\section{Relationship to previous work}

\lou{myung \& pitt -- good but requires manually deriving equations for every new experiment design setup}

\lou{related work on value of information? (e.g., emma pierson's cogsci paper)}

\lou{find related active learning stuff}

\lou{look into wikipedia article on bayesian experimental design}

\section{Discussion}

Scientists aim to design experiments that maximize the informativeness of the results.
Our approach partially automates this process, using probabilistic programming in the service of a kind of active Bayesian model comparison.
\cas{our work does not replace scientists -- it still requires human intelligence to make models, design an experiment space, and set up measures. instead, it frees them to work on more interesting stuff}

\lou{could easily use something other than KL, e.g, TV distance}

\lou{future research: inference techniques specialized for this domain (e.g., you don't need to estimate $m_1(x)$ and $m_2(x)$ perfectly if you have evidence that $m_1(x) \approx m_2(x)$)}

\lou{make connections to AB/multivariate testing}

\lou{say some stuff about OED for non-psych experiments (e.g., physics)}

\lou{extending to parameter-free predictions?}

\lou{could prove particularly useful in studies of patient populations (difficult/impossible to get high N, so you really wanna make sure the experiment counts)}
